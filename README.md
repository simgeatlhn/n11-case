# N11 Case Study
Developed this project to display sponsored and regular products in a listing format and to show detailed product pages. The application was created programmatically using UIKit and SnapKit, ensuring modularity and adherence to SOLID principles with the VIPER architecture. I integrated third-party libraries like Alamofire and Kingfisher to manage network requests and load images via the Swift Package Manager (SPM).
