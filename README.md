# N11 Case Study
Developed this project to display sponsored and regular products in a listing format and to show detailed product pages. The application was created programmatically using UIKit and SnapKit, ensuring modularity and adherence to SOLID principles with the VIPER architecture. To manage network requests and load images, I integrated third-party libraries like Alamofire and Kingfisher via the Swift Package Manager (SPM).
